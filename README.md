Some experiments of 3D modeling and drawing with OGL

I made a lot of 3D experiments with Zdog in the project zdogXperiments :

To well begin the 2020 year, I decided to adapt some of my 3D experiments in WebGL. 
For my first experiments, I chose to work with OGL, a lightweight JS library with a big potential.
