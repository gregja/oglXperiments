Some experiments of 3D modeling and drawing with OGL

During the 2019 year, I made a lot of experiments around 3D modelization, with Processing.js and P5.js, and with the excellent Zdog project :

To well begin the 2020 year, I decided to adapt some of my 3D experiments to WebGL. 

For my first experiments with WebGL, I chose to work with OGL.js, a lightweight JS and powerful project.
